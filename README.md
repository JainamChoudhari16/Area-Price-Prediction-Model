# House-Price-Prediction-Model

In this repository, you will find a simple machine-learning model built & deployed to predict house prices based on the data it is trained on.

## Data Frame

The data frame used to train this model contains the house area, number of bedrooms, age, and price for each house.

## Model

For this model, a multiple linear regression algorithm was implemented using supervised machine learning. The model can predict house prices once trained on the provided data frame.
