# Area-Price-Prediction-Model

This repository contains a simple machine learning model for predicting area prices based on dataframe on which it is trained.

## DataFrame

The dataframe used to train this model consists of areas with their labeled prices. 

## Model

The model is a simple machine learning algorithm trained on the provided dataframe to predict area prices. In this model, I have used Simple Linear Regression Algorithm of Supervised Machine Learning.
